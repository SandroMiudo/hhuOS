## Introduction

Welcome to hhuOS, a **small operating system** written in C++ and Assembler for the x86-architecture. The main purpose of this project is to show how different aspects of operating systems theory can be implemented and linked together. The system is *not* aimed to be a full-featured operating system for daily use.

This is a project by the [Operating Systems group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/operating-systems.html) at the *Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf*.

## Run without building

We provide nightly builds of our `master` and `development` branches via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/releases). Execute the following commands to download and run the latest `master` build in QEMU (on Ubuntu 22.04):

```shell
sudo apt install wget qemu-system-x86
mkdir -p hhuOS
cd hhuOS
wget https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/releases/download/nightly-master/hhuOS-master.tar.gz
tar -xzf hhuOS-master.tar.gz
./run.sh
```

The OS will boot into a shell with some UNIX-like commands. Run `ls /bin` to see all available applications. Try out `bug` and `battlespace` for some old-fashioned games!

If QEMU hangs on a black screen, try executing `./run.sh --bios true --file hhuOS-limine.iso`. There seems to be a problem with older QEMU versions and new OVMF images.



## Build from source

GCC (>=7), CMake (>=3.14) and some other dependencies are required to compile hhuOS. To install them, you can run the following command (on Ubuntu 22.04):

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential nasm gcc-multilib g++-multilib cmake python3 python3-distutils xorriso dosfstools mtools unzip wget ffmpeg git recode jq
```

Afterward, clone this repository and execute the included build-script:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS.git
cd hhuOS
./build.sh
```

To test hhuOS in QEMU, simply execute the included run-script:

```shell
./run.sh
```

## USB Integration

Controller types :
- uhci
- ohci
- ehci
- xhci

**Currently only the UHCI driver is implemented.**

### Linux

Uses QEMU's pass-trough mechanism to pass host devices to hhuOS.

Currently there are two script invocations supported . The `manual run` is mainly used to just pass a custom selection of devices to the system.

The `auto run` however will look for every device that matches with a pre-defined device entry and pass them to the system. This approach is handy, if all devices should be passed to the system on the fly.

#### Manual Run

```shell
./run.sh --usb type=[controller_type],vendorid=[],productid=[],port=[a.b];[vendorid=[],productid=[],port=[a.b]...]
```

Gathering vendor/product id can be done, by executing the command `lsusb`.

`[a.b] : a = [1-2] ; b = [1-8]` -> Allocating a port outside this boundary will not work.

#### Auto Run

```shell
./run.sh --usb-fast [controller_type]
```

Auto-matching of all available devices in host system. Extend this **[file](src/device/usb/usb_supported_devices.yml)** to include your device to the auto matching. 

### Other

Due to the fact that QEMU's passthrough mechanism is only supported for Linux, the above described script invocations will **not work**.

**Currently just using emulated devices was not tested sufficiently, meaning that this approach is not guarenteed to work.**

## Custom USB Driver

Want to write a custom USB Driver to extend the USB System ? Follow the instructions in the [USB section](src/kernel/usb/CONTRIBUTE.md), in which the basics of writing a USB Driver are explained.

## What next?

Congratulations! If you have made it this far, you have successfully compiled and run hhuOS! If you have not done so yet, you should definitely try out the included games `bug`, `battlespace` and `dino`, as well as the `demo` command, to see the capabilities of our user space game engine.

When you are done tinkering with the OS, why not try to build your own application for hhuOS? Our [wiki](https://github.com/hhuOS/hhuOS/wiki/) provides tutorials on how to set up a development environment and get started with app development for hhuOS.
